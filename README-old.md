# DFJavaResourcesPlus
Simple resource pack to support the textures used in DFSmpPlugin.  
Java Edition (1.21.2-1.21.4+)

requires 1.21.2+ for custom equipment textures. 
  
This resource pack supercedes DFJavaResources because 1.21.4 screwed up some custommodelid nonsense, and I decided to restart.
  
the minecraft/models folder is for 1.21.2-1.21.3,  
the minecraft/items folder is for 1.21.4+
  
See `customidtable.yml` to how the custom ids work.

## omitted content
- ./assets/minecraft/sounds/records/
  - this folder contains songs of which some are copywrited.
  - to stay safe, i'm ommitting the entire folder.
  - it's not required for the resource pack to work, anyway.
